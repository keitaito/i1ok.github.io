In this Sat morning, good weather, I went to Andytown Coffee Roasters with my friend. It is located at 3655 Lawton St, Sunset, very close to the Ocean Beach. 

When I get there, it's been a long line already, today was the grand opening day. The cafe is really good. There is cozy small, clean and nice decor. The staff is very friendly, Lauren made me very good coffee, thx. I ordered latte, which is very smooth and mild. It was so nice to wake up in the morning. It was so crowd today, I will definitely go there again. It's really good for Sunset to have the cool cafe in the area. It was just five-minute-walking distance to the Ocean Beach from the cafe. 

Good coffee, good weather, good Saturday morning, good friend, good vibes. It's awesome morning.
