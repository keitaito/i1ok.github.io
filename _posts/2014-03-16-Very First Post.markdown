title: My Very First Post
---

Thi is my very first post from my GitHub Page with Jekyll. To make this GitHub Page/Blog, I took 2 or 3 weeeks. It was sooo long. There were many many many things I had to figure out and work out. I will leave notes of it later, before I forget everything ;)

Actually, this post is a test writing by markdown. The fisrt time I heard the name "markdown", I had no idea what it is and I had a misunderstanding with "markup". However, once I learned what it is, I think markdown is a very easy writing way and a language, I'm not sure I can call it a language though.

Why do I want to start using Jekyll?
------------------------------------

The reason is, I could say, to make my portfolio easily and look nice. One of my friend, Kyoro san, Suggested me using Twitter Bootstrap to make my web page. It's beacause Bootstrap easily make websites layout nice and modern. It's a very good idea and I checked it out, actually I learned Bootstrap before but I forgot almost everything now... After googling and checking Bootstrap official page, I learned Bootstrap page is made on GitHub Pages. I got an interest in using GitHub Pages. Then, I jumped in GitHub Pages offical page. I founded Jekyll then. GitHub Pages supports Jekyll, or Jekyll supports GitHub Pages.

Using GitHub Pages/GitHug is the really good way to show my portfolio and code. It will be a good place where I can get a feedback easily. I want to get front-end skills now, Jekyll can make only static websites. It is good to use JavaScript there. Bootstrap goes well with JavaScript. I guess GitHub Pages & Jekyll & Bootstrap are a perfect combo for me.

I put these links below.

* [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/)
* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)

I'm excited to edit my page! In the meantime, I'm thinking about my WordPress page, my domain name is used by it. Well...
