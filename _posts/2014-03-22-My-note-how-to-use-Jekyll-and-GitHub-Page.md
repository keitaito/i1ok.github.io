title: My note how to use Jekyll and GitHub Page
---

Since I'm a really forgetful person, I wrote this post especially for myself. I leave just a few commands for now how to use Jekyll and GitHub Page.

1. Make a post in the GitHub page directory(or repository).
2. To see if it works well, check it out local. cd to the directory and command jekyll serve, then go to localhost:4000.
3. command git add -A
4. command git commit 
5. command git push origin master
6. Go to your GitHub Page. Here we go.
