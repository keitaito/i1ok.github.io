Coachella 2014 has kicked off. Friday's headliner was Outkast. This was the first time after 10 years last time they played. Saturday's headliner is Muse, and Sunday's headliner is Arcade Fire.

I went to Coachella 2012, 2 years ago. It was just 2 weeks after I came to the US. I got a ticket with an express bus pass from San Francisco to the venue as regular price on Craigslist. After I got the ticket, I ran in REI outdoor shop to rent a tent for one person and a sleeping bag. I have been to Fuji Rock Festival in Japan and have camped out. Since I already got used to do that, It was no problem even though I do it on my own. Looking back on that, my reckless challenge was incredible success. 

The reason why I really wanted to go to Coachlla was, yes of course, RADIOHEAD was one of 2012 headliners! Their concert was one of the best time in my life. In addition, I met Ed O'brien, the guitarist of Radiohead, when I was at Modeslektor's concert after Radiohead. He was behind me, and the guy standing next to me noticed first, then I noticed, too. I had a shake hand with him. Ohhh, It was so exciting. After that, as soon as Ed disappeared into a crowd, Thom Yorke, the vocalist of Radiohead, showed on the stage surprisingly then sang Shipwrek with Modeselektor. [Here is the video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eYmXqgNsUc) Youtube, you're awesome.

I still remember there atomosphere, the hella hot air daytime, a glow-color sunset, a lighting ferris wheel, cool grass at the night, lemonade and pizza at festival-price, and cool people. Especially, I met one girl in the bus going to the venue. Though, I didn't meet her again in the venue, we met again downtown San Francisco by coincidence. Now, she lives in New York, and I live the apartment where she used to live and introduced me to its owner as a successor. Thank you, Small Book!

That's the stories of my Coachella 2012. Unfortunately, I couldn't make it to Coachella this year, but I will be there again definitely!
