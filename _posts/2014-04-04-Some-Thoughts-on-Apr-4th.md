# Some Thoughts on Apr 4th

Just leave some notes and thoughts.

## Atom's Markdown preview mode

Do you still use Atom, Github's new hackable editor for the 21st century? Honestly, I don't much. However, I learned today that Atom has Markdown preview mode (Thanks Ando san for sharing this tip on FB.)

It's really easy to use the preview mode.
First, change the editor mode to GitHub Markdown from the bottom of the editor (actually I want to know this shortcut key command). Then, At the menu bar, go to Packages => Markdown => Toggle Preview. That's it! The preview window should be at the right side now.

Let's type something Markdown syntax! For instance, ```# for headings```. Writings you typed should be transformed on Markdown immediately. Cool, huh?

One of problems is, I guess, HTML tags doesn't work on a preview window, like br tags. Hope it will be fixed on updates.
