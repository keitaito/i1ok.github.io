# which do you like?

Personally, I prefer Foursquare to Yelp.

First, People (Friends) on Foursquare do check-in more than on Yelp. It makes that I can see who has been to certain places on each place. I can see firends' recommendations. I think friends' recommendations are better info than others' recommendations, which is most parts of Yelp. It's because I rely on friends connections info more.

Second, Sometimes stranges information is not useful. Especially, about restaurants, each person has their own preference, taste, style. Some people's opinions don't match my preference. 

Third, generally, I guess Yelp reviews are longer than Foursquare ones. To get info quickly, foursquare reviews are easy to read. 

I know it probably doesn't make sense that Foursquare and Yelp are categoraized in the same as review apps. Yelp is a review app. Foursquare is a check-in app. But, they have reached each other and they have almost same features. I think comparison between them is an interesting topic. I will update this post later, maybe.
