title: My custom domain on GitHub Pages
---

Today, I set up the url of my GitHub Page, this page, using my own domain. I leave a note how to set it up.

## Situation 

* The page I set up the url of was a GitHub profile page, this default url was username.github.io. 
* This page is powered by Jekyll.
* I got my domain, keitaito.com, on GoDaddy.
* keitaito.com is currently used for my WordPress blog hosting by Bluehost.

## Process

1. Make CNAME file in GitHub repo.

2. Create subdomain on Bluehost.

3. Using DNS manaegr zone editor, Set subdomain's A file up to point to GitHub page's IP address.

4. Take your time, I guess it will take more than 1 hour at least.

5. Here we go!
